FAANG HLD (High Level Design) interviews are very pattern-driven, but interviewers don’t think in terms of “patterns” explicitly. They think in terms of decision-making ability under constraints. Your preparation must mirror how they design systems, not how blogs list topics.
The Universal FAANG HLD Flow (Must Memorize)
1. Clarify requirements
   - Functional
   - Non-functional (scale, latency, consistency)

2. Define core entities & APIs

3. High-level architecture
   - Clients
   - Services
   - Databases
   - Caches
   - Queues

4. Data modeling

5. Scaling strategy
   - Read scale
   - Write scale

6. Bottlenecks & optimizations

7. Failure handling

8. Trade-offs & alternatives
