Perfect 👍
Let’s run a **REAL Google-style mock interview** — exactly how it feels in an L5/L6 round.

I’ll act as the **Google interviewer**.
You are the **candidate**.

# 🧠 GOOGLE MOCK INTERVIEW

**Round: Coding + Explanation**
**Duration: ~45 minutes**
**Difficulty: Medium → Hard**
**Focus:** Graph + DP thinking, clarity, correctness

---

## 📋 INTERVIEW RULES (IMPORTANT)

1. **Do NOT jump into coding immediately**
2. First:

   * Clarify the problem
   * Talk through your approach
   * Define states / algorithm
3. I will:

   * Ask follow-up questions
   * Push on edge cases
   * Test optimization & reasoning
4. After your solution:

   * We’ll do a **Google-style feedback**
   * I’ll tell you **PASS / BORDERLINE / STRONG PASS**

# 🧩 PROBLEM 1 (Primary Question)

### 🔥 Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix

> Given an `m x n` integer matrix, return the length of the **longest increasing path**.

### Rules:

* From each cell, you can move **up, down, left, right**
* You may **not move diagonally**
* You may **not wrap around**
* Path must be **strictly increasing**

---

### Example

```
matrix =
[
  [9, 9, 4],
  [6, 6, 8],
  [2, 1, 1]
]
```

### Output

```
4
```

### Explanation

One longest increasing path:

```
1 → 2 → 6 → 9
```

## 🎯 EXPECTED SKILLS (What I’m Evaluating)

* Correct problem modeling
* Avoiding exponential DFS
* Using **DP / memoization**
* Time & space complexity reasoning
* Clear explanation

---

## 🚦 INTERVIEW STARTS NOW

### 👉 Step 1 (You answer this first)

Please explain **your approach**:

* How would you model this problem?
* DFS / BFS / DP / Graph?
* What is your DP state?
* How do you avoid recomputation?

❗ **Do NOT write code yet**
Just explain your thinking as if you’re in the interview.

👉 **Your turn.**
