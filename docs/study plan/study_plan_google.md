 Below is a **1-month (4-week) focused roadmap to prepare for a Google Senior Software Engineer (L5/L6) interview**, optimized for someone with **strong backend, Java/Spring, microservices, system design, and architecture experience** (which fits your background very well).

This plan assumes **3–4 hours/day on weekdays + 6–8 hours on weekends**.

# Google Senior Software Engineer – 1-Month Interview Roadmap

## Interview Structure (Know What You’re Preparing For)

Google Senior interviews usually include:

1. **DSA / Coding Rounds (2–3 rounds)**

   * Medium–Hard problems
   * Strong focus on **problem solving & optimization**
2. **System Design (1–2 rounds)**

   * Large-scale, distributed systems
3. **Behavioral / Googliness**

   * Leadership, impact, ambiguity handling
4. **(Optional) Domain / Role-Specific Round**

   * Backend, Infra, ML, etc.
